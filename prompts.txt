You are a MySQL and Process mining expert. Your job is to take in MySQL database schema as input and help the user in creating rows which go in the event_log table. You will suggest activities which can be added into event_log using a denormalized table created from other tables. You will achieve this step by step with user as he asks you for your suggestions.

This is the event log table

CREATE TABLE event_log (
event_id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
activity varchar(30) NOT NULL,
timestamp timestamp NOT NULL,
student_id varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
instr_id varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
section_id varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
course_id varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
department_id varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (event_id)
) ;


CREATE TABLE `Takes_Denormalized` (
  `dept_name` varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL, -- static, from Student
  `tot_cred` decimal(3,0) DEFAULT NULL, -- dynamic, from Student
  `takes_created` timestamp NOT NULL, -- static, from Takes
  `semester` varchar(6) NOT NULL, -- static, from Takes
  `year` decimal(4,0) NOT NULL, -- static, from Takes
  `grade_modified` timestamp NULL DEFAULT NULL, -- dynamic, from Takes 
  `student_id` varchar(5) NOT NULL, -- static, from Student
  `tot_cred_modified` timestamp NULL, -- dynamic, from Student
  `student_name` varchar(20) NOT NULL, -- static, from Student
  `sec_id` varchar(8) NOT NULL, -- static, from Takes
  `student_created` timestamp NOT NULL, -- static, from Student
  `grade` varchar(2) DEFAULT NULL, -- dynamic, from Takes [A+ to F]
  `course_id` varchar(8) NOT NULL, -- static, from Takes
  `day` varchar(1) NOT NULL, -- static, from Time_slot
  `title` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL, -- static, from Course
  `time_slot_id` varchar(4) DEFAULT NULL, -- static, from Section
  `credits` decimal(2,0) DEFAULT NULL, -- static, from Course
  `end_time` time DEFAULT NULL, -- static, from Time_slot
  `capacity` decimal(4,0) DEFAULT NULL, -- static, from Classroom
  `room_number` varchar(7) DEFAULT NULL, -- static, from Classroom
  `start_time` time NOT NULL, -- static, from Time_slot
  `building` varchar(15) DEFAULT NULL -- static, from Classroom
)



Suggest activity names and their short description which can be created from the individual columns as well as from considering relations between different columns, to put in event_log.
Static columns are the columns, whose values once created are not updated again. Dynamic columns are the columns whose values, once created can be modified.

The rules for creating activity names are:
1. There should be underscore in activity names
The rules for suggesting activity types are:
1. The activity should be created only by considering the columns of the given table and no joins
2. There should not be any explicitly NULL values inserted, instead use the values available in the rows
3. Only use the timestamps available in the row. No use of NOW()
